<p style="text-align: justify">
I completed my postdoctoral research fellowship in 2020 at the <a href="https://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="https://www.scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a>'s <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">Software and Societal Systems Department</a> (formerly Institute for Software Research) in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, where my advisor is <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>, after receiving a PhD <!--in Human-Computer Interaction--> and a MSc in Information Systems in 2016 and 2009 respectively from the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University</a> in Singapore, and a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon, Myanmar.

<p style="text-align: justify">
My research focuses on the area of collaboration and coordination, and I investigate how these actions unfolds in time-bounded events (e.g., hackathons organized for various purposes in contexts ranging from education, scientific communities, and software business), <i>and</i> an open digital network (e.g., GitHub.com where individuals or teams of developers collectively produce digital software or non-software artifacts), and devise practises to design the future coordinated work.

Prior to joining CMU, I was a research associate and adjunct lecturer from 2015 to 2016 at the Nanyang Technological University where I taught information visualization and managing information systems to undergraduates and graduates, which was preceded by a 13-month job of applications consultant at <a href="https://www.ncs.co/en-sg/">NCS Pte Ltd</a> in Singapore, where I involved in a healthcare project--the maintenance of a web-based outpatient administrative system particularly on the accounting module, developed using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server, and deployed in a network of hospitals, speciality centers, and polyclinics under SingHealth, and developed a new tool that solicits patients' feedback and complaints. Before Singapore, I spent 18 months at the Software Department of the University of Computer Studies (Yangon) as a trainee tutor where I taught the undergraduates the fundamentals of data structures and a few lectures on operating systems.

<p style="text-align: justify"><u><b>RESEARCH</b></u>. My research aims at contributing to the coordination theory with a particular focus on the effective and efficient dissemination and coordination of work in an open connected network of mobile networks, each either “adapting” digital artifacts for independent missions or producing work “perfecting” the original digital artifact. Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of the understanding of how coordination unfolds in such a highly connected network of networks, and how and why humans navigate and make decisions in such a setting. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of computer science, psychology, applied mathematics and statistics, economics and management science, and has many applications in areas including astronomy, medicine, robotics, and cyber security, crisis management, and collaborative writing.</p>

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->
<!--
<p style="text-align: justify"><u><b>EDUCATION</b></u>. I completed my postdoctoral research fellowship at the Software and Societal Systems Department (formerly Institute for Software Research) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2020 after receiving a Ph.D in Information Science and a M.Sc. in Information Systems in 2016 and 2009 respectively from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore where I was mainly affiliated with the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI), and a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar.</p>
