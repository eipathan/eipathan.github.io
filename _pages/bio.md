<p style="text-align: justify"><!--<u><b>EDUCATION</b></u>.-->
    I completed my postdoctoral research fellowship at the Software and Societal Systems Department (formerly Institute for Software Research) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2020 after receiving a Ph.D in Information Science and a M.Sc. in Information Systems in 2016 and 2009 respectively from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore where I was mainly affiliated with the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI), and a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar.

<p style="text-align: justify"><!--<u><b>EXPERIENCE</b></u>.-->
    Before CMU, I was a research associate and adjunct lecturer at NTU's WKWSCI where I taught information visualization and managing information systems to undergraduates and graduates, which was preceded by a 13-month job of application consultant at NCS, where I involved in the maintenance of a web-based outpatient administrative system, focusing particularly on billing and accounting module, developed using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server, and for the development of a new tool soliciting patient feedback and complaints. I also spent 18 months at the Software Department in UCSY as a trainee tutor where I taught the undergraduates fundamentals of data structures and a few lectures on operating systems.
