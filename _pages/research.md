My research aims at contributing to the <span style="color:#f44336;"><b>"theory of coordination"</b></span>, with a particular focus on developing strategies for the effective and efficient dissemination and coordination of work contributed by individuals, teams or crowds in an open connected digital networks of network through an empirical mixed-methods case study research approach, employing ethnography (interviews and observations), survey, and archival analysis (collection and analysis of logs and trace data with Python, R, and Dedoose), and a combination of all of these methods whenever relevant. My work to date has taken place in contexts including education, scientific communities, open source and commerical software businesses, and may be applicable to other contexts such as healthcare.
<!-- draft
I therefore study how the events are designed, how teams work together, and how technology support the events and the teams in contexts including education, scientific communities, open source and commerical software businesses.
Work in such environment is performed by individuals, teams, or crowds, and may either take a form of “adapting” digital artifacts for independent missions or “perfecting” the original digital artifact.

Recently, much of my work has focused on large scale coordination in the development of software and non-software artifacts in, </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:30pt;"><span style="color:#f44336;"><b>Time-bounded events for software development (known as hackathons)</b></span> where small teams work over a specified period to complete a project of interest. My work particularly looks into how such events are organized, what the hackathon teams do, and what outcomes they produce, observing the pre-existing and newly-formed teams in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/tag/2017-hackathon/">2017 Micorsoft OneWeek Hackathon</a>, and co-organizing and studying a series of hackathons with NASA's <a href="https://hubblesite.org/home">Hubble Space Telescope</a> team at the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/home">STScI</a>). Based on our experience of organizing and studying multiple hackathons, we developed a <a href="https://hackathon-planning-kit.org/">hackathon planning kit</a> for potential hackathon organizers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left:30pt;"><span style="color:#f44336;"><b>Open collaboraitve writing projects in GitHub.com</b></span> where I explore how the widely used "fork-and-pull" model of distributed version management system in software development supports coordination and public contribution in collaborative writing through a case study of two open-text projects (or GitHub repositories): a mathematics textbook on <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book">homotopy type theory (HoTT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy">open source policies by 18F</a>, a branch of federal agency of the United States Government, and reconstruct how text artifacts were created.</p>

Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of the understanding of how coordination unfolds in such a highly connected network of networks, and how and why humans navigate and make decisions in such a setting. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of computer science, psychology, applied mathematics and statistics, economics and management science, and has many applications in areas including astronomy, medicine, robotics, and cyber security, crisis management, and collaborative writing.

Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->
